The idea here is to record ambient state of my residence.

## What's the Impetus? 

As I've aged, the quality of my sleep has deteriorated.  Naturally, I'd like to fix this.  How might I go about doing so?  Collect data.

This page is limited to how I record ambient measures of the room in which I regularly sleep.  My hope is to combine this with the sleep quality data from a wearable to identify any trends.

### The Set Up

I have a [raspberrypi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) with a [SenseHat](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/sense-hat/) attachment.   After installing the [sense-hat python package](https://pythonhosted.org/sense-hat/), I created a script which records each of the following
- Temperature (in Celcius)
- Pressure (in Millibars)
- Humidity (percentage)
- Orientation (in degrees)
   + pitch 
   + roll
   + yaw
- Acceleration (in G's)
   + pitch
   + roll
   + yaw  

to a dated csv stored on the pi.  This script then runs at an arbirary time interval via [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)---currently set to every five minutes.  Note, unless my neighbors are especially amorous or [another earthquake hits SLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Salt_Lake_City_earthquake), I don't expect much variation in orientation or acceleration.

I have also set up a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database and schema in which to store these data.   This is accomplished through an [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) [DAG](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/dags.html#dags) on a daily basis.  Both the postgres database and the Airflow instance are hosted locally on a home server.

## Where Things Stand  

The data currently look as follows:  

```
# select * from ambience.readings limit 5;  
  reading_id              |         reading_dttm          |        temp        |     pressure     |      humidity      |        pitch        |        roll         |        yaw        |        accel_x        |        accel_y        |      accel_z       | location_id

```

Below and Above, `LOCATION_ID` indicates the physical location as described in the `ambience.location` table, e.g. address, etc. of the pi (information I'm not keen to share publicly).  
As of August 20, 2023, the queries below have the following results.  

```
# select location_id,min(reading_dttm),max(reading_dttm) from ambience.readings group by location_id;
1 | 2022-12-27 00:00:02.845534-07 | 2023-08-18 23:55:02.191325-06

# select location_id,count(*) as reading_count from ambience.readings group by location_id;
1 |        463939
```

### Possible Extensions

Create a recurring jupyter notebook report which demonstrates the database state, updated on a regular basis.

Adding a second raspberrypi-sensehat, placing it in my living room to look for any deviations between rooms.  

Comparing the ambient measures in my bedroom (and/or living room) against the external weather to estimate my electricity and/or heating bill.

### To-Do

Explore adding a pi-specific id to the `ambience.location` table---potentially a pi-specific table.  

Find a non-hardcoded mechanism by which to associate pi readings with a given location/pi.

## Concluding Thoughts

Does this code make use of best practices?  
*Likely not.  I make no claims to being a data engineer.*

Does it work?  
*It does.*

Have you done anything with this data?  
*Not yet.  I am still in the data-gathering phase.*
